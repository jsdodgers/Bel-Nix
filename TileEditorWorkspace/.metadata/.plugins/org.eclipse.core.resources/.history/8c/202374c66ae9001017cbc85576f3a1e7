	// This constructor builds up to three smileys in the group.  You
	// can construct each face either from scratch or as a copy of an
	// existing one, setting the attributes of the various face parts,
	// translating and/or scaling face parts, or translating the
	// entire smiley face.
	//
	// See the lab write-up for the kinds of smiley faces we're expecting
	// you to create and the methods we expect you to employ.
	//
	// The predefined Colors are
	//		BLACK, BLUE, CYAN, GRAY, DARK_GRAY, LIGHT_GRAY, GREEN, MAGENTA,
	//		ORANGE, PINK, RED, WHITE, YELLOW
	//
	// The exact characteristics (shape, color, position) of each smiley are
	// up to you; on the lab exam, you will be given specific instructions
	// on what the smileys' characteristics are required to be.
